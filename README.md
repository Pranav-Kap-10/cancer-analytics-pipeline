# cancer-analytics-pipeline
Scalable cancer analytics pipeline in Python to process 50K+ patient records across 10 countries. Includes EDA, statistical testing, feature selection, and ML models to identify risk factors, predict severity, and automate insights for healthcare policy and research.

# ðŸ§¬ Cancer Analytics Pipeline (Python + ML)

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This project implements a **scalable cancer analytics pipeline** in Python to analyze **50,000+ patient records** across 10 countries.  
It integrates **data cleaning, EDA, statistical analysis, and machine learning models** to uncover meaningful predictors of cancer severity and risk factors.  

The pipeline supports **demographic, clinical, and economic trend analysis**, helping accelerate data-driven insights for **healthcare policy and medical research**.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features
- âœ… **Data Processing**: Cleaned, transformed, and standardized patient records using **Pandas & NumPy**.  
- âœ… **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Applied statistical summaries, correlation heatmaps, and distribution plots.  
- âœ… **Feature Engineering & Selection**: Used **Random Forest feature importance** to identify key predictors.  
- âœ… **Statistical Testing**: Conducted **hypothesis testing** (t-tests, chi-square) for clinical insights.  
- âœ… **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented **regression & classification** models to predict cancer severity.  
- âœ… **Automation**: Built reusable **Python workflows** for cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.  
- âœ… **Visualization**: Created clear plots (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for clinical and economic trends.
